        This tutorial was inspired by a talk given by Dave Jones at <a href="https://twitter.com/pythonnw">Python North West</a>.
        The flights database, and much of the SQL code, is taken, with grateful thanks,
        from the <a href="https://waveform.org.uk/presentations/sql">slides</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/waveform80/presentations">source code</a> for that talk.
